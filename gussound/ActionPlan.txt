Allow using several sources.
These should be used for sound effects.

The sound effects will support playing both 2D and 3D mode sounds for the same content, but with different source locations.

Limitations: you cannot control individually a sound once you start it?
  E.g. play a taunting sound from 2-3 creeps. You're running away from it. You should be able to update and lower the sound volume for all of them.
  

Functions are needed to obtain the length of a sound to be used as an effect.
Music Management classes are still needed.
The sound effects and music sounds could be considered to be different enough to warrant the use of separate classes.

Classes:
- SoundContent (buffer/stream), containing length, size, playback rate, information
- SoundSource (source + link to sound content?)
    => you should be able to create an anonymous source and play it 2D/3D in a simple manner, with no further control.
    => you should be able to also create a named source and control it in a complex manner afterwards.
- SoundManager, MusicPlayer, etc: just as up to now.
    => ogg_streaming helper class (SoundContent related) should contain needed functionality, if not available in OpenAL directly.
